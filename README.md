# batch-processing
This repository will host a collection of scripts that deal with common batch processing operations. As of now, there is only a single file, but I intend on more to come.

##  batch-unzip.py
This script extracts all compressed (zipped) files that are located in the user's default "Downloads" folder. These files are extracted to an uncompressed folder of the same name as the ZIP file, and then deletes the subsequent ZIP file once the data are extracted.
